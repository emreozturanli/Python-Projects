# CREATING A LIBRARY WITH SQLITE
---
* In this project you will learn how to use SQLite with Python better in a simple library example.

* It is better to learn some basic SQLite codes beforehand.
  
* In the library_class.py file you will see some classes and its methods.

* In the example.py file you will see some codes which use our library_class module to get some output. 

* You can use library_class.py file as a module if you want or just copy codes from two files and use them in your favourite IDE.

* Hope you enjoy it.
